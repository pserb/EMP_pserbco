BinSearch and LinSearch use Comparable types as inputs.
However, when trying to create and fill in a Comparable array of 1 billion, Java runs out of memory.

However, ints are much less memory intensive - you can make and populate a 1 billion length int array in
around 1.2 seconds.
Therefore, we can augment BinSearch.java and LinSearch.java to take int types as inputs, altering the code
slightly to work with ints, allowing us to run these search methods on arrays that are much much larger.
