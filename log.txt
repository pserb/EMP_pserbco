jothman: added plan

pserb: 
    * Created IntBinSearch.java and IntLinSearch.java, nearly identical classes as BinSearch and LinSearch,
    augmented to use int arrays searching for int targets.
    * Filled out SearchDriver.java, using new classes, running 1,000 trials searching for random
    values on 1 billion length int arrays, logging times in respective ArrayLists for both binary and linear search.
    The random values are shared among the two: if 12 randomly picked, both search for 12, logging times in ArrayList
    * Created static method sum(ArrayList<Long>) in SearchDriver to calculate the sum of search times
    * Main method prints:
        - Length to create and populate array (milliseconds)
        - BinSearch total and average time (milliseconds)
        - LinSearch total and average time (milliseconds)
        - Program total time (milliseconds and seconds)

andrew: 
    * Went through pserbs code and added comments to understand better what each method, timer, and line did. 
    * Ran it a few times to test out a few ArrayList sizes just to see how long it takes. Took pretty long...
    * Renamed IntBinSearch/IntLinSearch to BinSearch/LinSearch and deleted original BinSearch/LinSearch to make it easier;
        - for BinSearch decided to go with the iterative approach beacuse uses less memory and was the default one before
