pserb: create repo, setup README, init all required files

01 | 12-17-2021 1:05...1:10pm
jothman: added plan

02 | 12-18-2021 11:50am...1:00pm
pserb: 
    * Created IntBinSearch.java and IntLinSearch.java, nearly identical classes as BinSearch and LinSearch,
    augmented to use int arrays searching for int targets.
    * Filled out SearchDriver.java, using new classes, running 1,000 trials searching for random
    values on 1 billion length int arrays, logging times in respective ArrayLists for both binary and linear search.
    The random values are shared among the two: if 12 randomly picked, both search for 12, logging times in ArrayList
    * Created static method sum(ArrayList<Long>) in SearchDriver to calculate the sum of search times
    * Main method prints:
        - Length to create and populate array (milliseconds)
        - BinSearch total and average time (milliseconds)
        - LinSearch total and average time (milliseconds)
        - Program total time (milliseconds and seconds)

andrew: 
    * Went through pserbs code and added comments to understand better what each method, timer, and line did. 
    * Ran it a few times to test out a few ArrayList sizes just to see how long it takes. Took pretty long...
    * Renamed IntBinSearch/IntLinSearch to BinSearch/LinSearch and deleted original BinSearch/LinSearch to make it easier;
        - for BinSearch decided to go with the iterative approach beacuse uses less memory and was the default one before



04 | 12-18-2021 6:00PM...7:00PM
andrew:
    * Created Andrews Tests folder to store original files using Comparable data types
    * Tested out several array lengths (1,000; 10,000; 100,000; 1,000,000; 10,000,000; 100,000,000; 200,000,000)
    * unfortunately as pserb already said values greater than 200,000,000 (like 300,000,000 and 1,000,000,000) would result in a OutofMemoryError

05 | 12-20-2021 9:00AM...9:10AM
pserb: filled out results section on README with results from searches on int arrays (note: not sure if we are allowed to use int arrays, or should stick with Comparables)


06 | 12-20-2021 7:30PM...8:30PM
joseph:
    * Tested SearchDriver.java with linear and binary search tests to confirm accuracy of data and hypothesis on different machine.
	(Did not change average data to skew findings).
    * added notes with more discoveries about our data and conclusions.
    * added Tests Performed (finalized plan that was carried out) and Conclusions to Readme file.


07 | 12-20-2021 9:20 ... 10:00
andrew:
    * Added code to SearchDriver.java to test worst case scenario
    * Added more to the results (worst case scenario)
