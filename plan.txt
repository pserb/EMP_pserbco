Step 1: Create large array (of size 10000).
Step 2: Fill in array using for loop, setting each value to its own index.
Step 3: Use two long variables to time (start & end). Right before starting search
(in main method), we set long variable start to current time since epoch, then right
after finishing (also in main method), we set end variable to current time since
epoch.
Step 4: Take the difference of end and start times, then compare results of
search times for LinSearch and BinSearch.
Step 5: Create driver class that runs this experiment many times at different array
lengths, different (randomized) test cases.
